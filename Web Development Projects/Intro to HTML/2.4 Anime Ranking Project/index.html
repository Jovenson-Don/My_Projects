 <h1>Joey Don's Favorite Animes</h1>
 <h2> My top 3 animes since my return</h2>
 <hr />

 <h3>Attack On Titan</h3>
 <p>The storytelling alone was top tier. I went through alot of emotions in my 2/3 weeks watching.</p>

 <h3>Solo Leveling</h3>
 <p>The concept of the show is one of my favorite. Plus the fighting scenes are great.</p>

 <h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
 <p>First episode left me speakless just like AOT.</p>
